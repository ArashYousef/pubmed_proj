TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.

AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and
      are maintained by high levels of virus persistence.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,

      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and
      are maintained by high levels of virus persistence.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.

LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and
      are maintained by high levels of virus persistence.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

LID - 10.1038/nrmicro2992 [doi]
AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.

AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and
      are maintained by high levels of virus persistence.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

      of the brain. Here, we demonstrate in 2 patients that treatment with interleukin 
      7, JC polyomavirus (JCV) capsid protein VP1, and a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist
      used as adjuvant, was well tolerated, and showed a very favorable safety profile 
      and unexpected efficacy that warrant further investigation.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a currently untreatable infection
      of the brain. Here, we demonstrate in 2 patients that treatment with interleukin 
      7, JC polyomavirus (JCV) capsid protein VP1, and a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist
      used as adjuvant, was well tolerated, and showed a very favorable safety profile 
      and unexpected efficacy that warrant further investigation.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.

AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.

AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.

LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.23319 [doi]
AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and
      are maintained by high levels of virus persistence.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and
      are maintained by high levels of virus persistence.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

LID - 10.1038/nrmicro2992 [doi]
AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.

AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and
      are maintained by high levels of virus persistence.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

      of the brain. Here, we demonstrate in 2 patients that treatment with interleukin 
      7, JC polyomavirus (JCV) capsid protein VP1, and a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist
      used as adjuvant, was well tolerated, and showed a very favorable safety profile 
      and unexpected efficacy that warrant further investigation.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a currently untreatable infection
      of the brain. Here, we demonstrate in 2 patients that treatment with interleukin 
      7, JC polyomavirus (JCV) capsid protein VP1, and a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist
      used as adjuvant, was well tolerated, and showed a very favorable safety profile 
      and unexpected efficacy that warrant further investigation.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.

AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.

AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.

LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.23319 [doi]
AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and
      are maintained by high levels of virus persistence.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and
      are maintained by high levels of virus persistence.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

LID - 10.1038/nrmicro2992 [doi]
AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.

AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and
      are maintained by high levels of virus persistence.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

      of the brain. Here, we demonstrate in 2 patients that treatment with interleukin 
      7, JC polyomavirus (JCV) capsid protein VP1, and a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist
      used as adjuvant, was well tolerated, and showed a very favorable safety profile 
      and unexpected efficacy that warrant further investigation.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a currently untreatable infection
      of the brain. Here, we demonstrate in 2 patients that treatment with interleukin 
      7, JC polyomavirus (JCV) capsid protein VP1, and a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist
      used as adjuvant, was well tolerated, and showed a very favorable safety profile 
      and unexpected efficacy that warrant further investigation.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.

AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.

AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.

LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.23319 [doi]
AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and
      are maintained by high levels of virus persistence.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.

AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

TI  - Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and
      cell tropism.
PG  - 7028-42
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00371-12 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.

TI  - Murine Polyomavirus Cell Surface Receptors Activate Distinct Signaling Pathways
      Required for Infection.
LID - e01836-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01836-16 [doi]
AB  - Virus binding to the cell surface triggers an array of host responses, including 
      activation of specific signaling pathways that facilitate steps in virus entry.
      Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we identified host signaling pathways activated
      upon virus binding to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Pathways activated by
      MuPyV included the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), FAK/SRC, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gangliosides and
      alpha4-integrin are required receptors for MuPyV infection. MuPyV binding to both
      gangliosides and the alpha4-integrin receptors was required for activation of the
      PI3K pathway; however, either receptor interaction alone was sufficient for
      activation of the MAPK pathway. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we confirmed
      that the PI3K and FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection, while the
      MAPK pathway was dispensable. Mechanistically, the PI3K pathway was required for 
      MuPyV endocytosis, while the FAK/SRC pathway enabled trafficking of MuPyV along
      microtubules. Thus, MuPyV interactions with specific cell surface receptors
      facilitate activation of signaling pathways required for virus entry and
      trafficking. Understanding how different viruses manipulate cell signaling
      pathways through interactions with host receptors could lead to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets for viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Virus 
      binding to cell surface receptors initiates outside-in signaling that leads to
      virus endocytosis and subsequent virus trafficking. How different viruses
      manipulate cell signaling through interactions with host receptors remains
      unclear, and elucidation of the specific receptors and signaling pathways
      required for virus infection may lead to new therapeutic targets. In this study, 
      we determined that gangliosides and alpha4-integrin mediate mouse polyomavirus
      (MuPyV) activation of host signaling pathways. Of these pathways, the PI3K and
      FAK/SRC pathways were required for MuPyV infection. Both the PI3K and FAK/SRC
      pathways have been implicated in human diseases, such as heart disease and
      cancer, and inhibitors directed against these pathways are currently being
      investigated as therapies. It is possible that these pathways play a role in
      human PyV infections and could be targeted to inhibit PyV infection in
      immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

AB  - BACKGROUND: WU and KI are human polyomaviruses initially detected in the
      respiratory tract, whose clinical significance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI 
      polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related
      epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from
      patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness
      using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding
      presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and
      coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3% and 
      74% respectively and 4.2% and 84% respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were
      observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with 
      chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection
      compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral
      load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a
      potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI
      viral load and illness severity.

TI  - Ganglioside and Non-ganglioside Mediated Host Responses to the Mouse
      Polyomavirus.
PG  - e1005175
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005175 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides serve as receptors for internalization and infection by members of
      the polyomavirus family. Specificity is determined by recognition of carbohydrate
      moieties on the ganglioside by the major viral capsid protein VP1. For the mouse 
      polyomavirus (MuPyV), gangliosides with terminal sialic acids in specific
      linkages are essential. Although many biochemical and cell culture experiments
      have implicated gangliosides as MuPyV receptions, the role of gangliosides in the
      MuPyV-infected mouse has not been investigated. Here we report results of studies
      using ganglioside-deficient mice and derived cell lines. Knockout mice lacking
      complex gangliosides were completely resistant to the cytolytic and pathogenic
      effects of the virus. Embryo fibroblasts from these mice were likewise resistant 
      to infection, and supplementation with specific gangliosides restored
      infectibility. Although lacking receptors for viral infection, cells from
      ganglioside-deficient mice retained the ability to respond to the virus.
      Ganglioside-deficient fibroblasts responded rapidly to virus exposure with a
      transient induction of c-fos as an early manifestation of a mitogenic response.
      Additionally, splenocytes from ganglioside-deficient mice responded to MuPyV by
      secretion of IL-12, previously recognized as a key mediator of the innate immune 
      response. Thus, while gangliosides are essential for infection in the animal,
      gangliosides are not required for mitogenic responses and innate immune responses
      to the virus.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of Murine Polyomavirus Capsid Proteins
      Establish the Determinants of Ligand Recognition and Pathogenicity.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and 
      hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside
      receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the
      receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically 
      alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus
      represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly
      influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these
      differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of
      three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the
      low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly 
      growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores
      infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between
      virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor
      that carries an additional linear [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal
      structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides
      from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular
      basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans 
      featuring the central [alpha-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established
      receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates
      binding. An extra [alpha-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is
      conserved among the three strains, while another, [alpha-2,6]-linked branching
      sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by 
      all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the
      binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [alpha-2,8]-linked
      sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges
      have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our
      results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A major impediment to economical, worldwide vaccine distribution is the
      requirement for a "cold chain" to preserve antigenicity. We addressed this
      problem using a model human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine stabilized by
      immobilizing HPV16 L1 capsomeres, i.e., pentameric subunits of the virus capsid, 
      within organic glasses formed by lyophilization. Lyophilized glass and liquid
      vaccine formulations were incubated at 50 degrees C for 12weeks, and then
      analyzed for retention of capsomere conformational integrity and the ability to
      elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization of BALB/c mice.
      Capsomeres in glassy-state vaccines retained tertiary and quaternary structure,
      and critical conformational epitopes. Moreover, glassy formulations adjuvanted
      with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide and glycopyranoside lipid A were
      not only as immunogenic as the commercially available HPV vaccine Cervarix(R),
      but also retained complete neutralizing immunogenicity after high-temperature
      storage. The thermal stability of such adjuvanted vaccine powder preparations may
      thus eliminate the need for the cold chain.

AB  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) is a recently identified human polyomavirus. Serology
      for MWPyV VP1 indicates that infection frequently occurs in childhood and reaches
      a prevalence of 75% in adults. The MWPyV small T antigen (ST) binds protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the large T antigen (LT) binds pRb, p107, p130, and
      p53. However, the MWPyV LT was less stable than the simian virus 40 (SV40) LT and
      was unable to promote the growth of normal cells. This report confirms that MWPyV
      is a widespread human virus expressing T antigens with low transforming
      potential.

AB  - STL polyomavirus (STLPyV) was recently identified in human specimens. To
      determine seropositivity for STLPyV, we developed an ELISA and screened patient
      samples from 2 US cities (Denver, Colorado [500]; St. Louis, Missouri [419]).
      Overall seropositivity was 68%-70%. The age-stratified data suggest that STLPyV
      infection is widespread and commonly acquired during childhood.

TI  - Structure analysis of the major capsid proteins of human polyomaviruses 6 and 7
      reveals an obstructed sialic acid binding site.
PG  - 10831-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and HPyV7 are commonly found on human
      skin. We have determined the X-ray structures of their major capsid protein, VP1,
      at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 A, respectively. In polyomaviruses, VP1 commonly
      determines antigenicity as well as cell-surface receptor specificity, and the
      protein is therefore linked to attachment, tropism, and ultimately, viral
      pathogenicity. The structures of HPyV6 and HPyV7 VP1 reveal uniquely elongated
      loops that cover the bulk of the outer virion surfaces, obstructing a groove that
      binds sialylated glycan receptors in many other polyomaviruses. In support of
      this structural observation, interactions of VP1 with alpha2,3- and
      alpha2,6-linked sialic acids could not be detected in solution by nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Single-cell binding studies indicate that
      sialylated glycans are likely not required for initial attachment to cultured
      human cells. Our findings establish distinct antigenic properties of HPyV6 and
      HPyV7 capsids and indicate that these two viruses engage nonsialylated receptors.
      IMPORTANCE: Eleven new human polyomaviruses, including the skin viruses HPyV6 and
      HPyV7, have been identified during the last decade. In contrast to better-studied
      polyomaviruses, the routes of infection, cell tropism, and entry pathways of many
      of these new viruses remain largely mysterious. Our high-resolution X-ray
      structures of major capsid proteins VP1 from HPyV6 and from HPyV7 reveal critical
      differences in surface morphology from those of all other known polyomavirus
      structures. A groove that engages specific sialic acid-containing glycan
      receptors in related polyomaviruses is obstructed, and VP1 of HPyV6 and HPyV7
      does not interact with sialylated compounds in solution or on cultured human
      cells. A comprehensive comparison with other structurally characterized
      polyomavirus VP1 proteins enhances our understanding of molecular determinants
      that underlie receptor specificity, antigenicity, and, ultimately, pathogenicity 
      within the polyomavirus family and highlight the need for structure-based
      analysis to better define phylogenetic relationships within the growing
      polyomavirus family and perhaps also for other viruses.

AB  - Multiple glycans have been identified as potential cell surface binding motifs
      for polyomaviruses (PyVs) using both crystallographic structural determinations
      and in vitro binding assays. However, binding alone does not necessarily imply
      that a glycan is a functional receptor, and confirmation that specific glycans
      are important for infection has proved challenging. In vivo analysis of murine
      polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV-glycan
      interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that
      similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the
      assays used for determining virus-glycan binding, and how these relate to known
      PyV tropism and pathogenesis.

TI  - Long-lasting T cell-independent IgG responses require MyD88-mediated pathways and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Many viruses induce acute T cell-independent (TI) B cell responses
      due to their repetitive epitopes and the induction of innate cytokines.
      Nevertheless, T cell help is thought necessary for the development of
      long-lasting antiviral antibody responses in the form of long-lived plasma cells 
      and memory B cells. We found that T cell-deficient (T cell receptor beta and
      delta chain [TCRbetadelta] knockout [KO]) mice persistently infected with
      polyomavirus (PyV) had long-lasting antiviral serum IgG, and we questioned
      whether they could generate TI B cell memory. TCRbetadelta KO mice did not form
      germinal centers after PyV infection, lacked long-lived IgG-secreting plasma
      cells in bone marrow, and did not have detectable memory B cell responses. Mice
      deficient in CD4(+) T cells had a lower persisting virus load than TCRbetadelta
      KO mice, and these mice had short-lived antiviral IgG responses, suggesting that 
      a high virus load is required to activate naive B cells continuously, and
      maintain the long-lasting serum IgG levels. Developing B cells in bone marrow
      encounter high levels of viral antigens, which can cross-link both their B cell
      receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and this dual engagement may lead 
      to a loss of their tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, antiviral serum
      IgG levels were greatly diminished in TCRbetadelta KO/MyD88(-/-) mice. We
      conclude that high persisting antigen levels and innate signaling can lead to the
      maintenance of long-lasting IgG responses even in the absence of T cell help.
      IMPORTANCE: Lifelong control of persistent virus infections is essential for host
      survival. Several members of the polyomavirus family are prevalent in humans,
      persisting at low levels in most people without clinical manifestations, but
      causing rare morbidity/mortality in the severely immune compromised. Studying the
      multiple mechanisms that control viral persistence in a mouse model, we
      previously found that murine polyomavirus (PyV) induces protective T
      cell-independent (TI) antiviral IgG. TI antibody (Ab) responses are usually
      short-lived, but T cell-deficient PyV-infected mice can live for many months.
      This study investigates how protective IgG is maintained under these
      circumstances and shows that these mice lack both forms of B cell memory, but
      they still have sustained antiviral IgG responses if they have high levels of
      persisting virus and intact MyD88-mediated pathways. These requirements may
      ensure life-saving protection against pathogens even in the absence of T cells,
      but they prevent the continuous generation of TI IgG against harmless antigens.

AB  - During the past 6 years, focused virus hunting has led to the discovery of nine
      new human polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, which has been
      linked to Merkel cell carcinoma, a lethal skin cell cancer. The discovery of so
      many new and highly divergent human polyomaviruses raises key questions regarding
      their evolution, tropism, latency, reactivation, immune evasion and contribution 
      to disease. This Review describes the similarities and differences among the new 
      human polyomaviruses and discusses how these viruses might interact with their
      human host.

TI  - Structures of Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 complexes define a sialic acid binding
      site required for infection.
PG  - e1002738
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002738 [doi]
AB  - The recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) causes the 
      aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the skin of immunocompromised
      individuals. Conflicting reports suggest that cellular glycans containing sialic 
      acid (Neu5Ac) may play a role in MCPyV infectious entry. To address this
      question, we solved X-ray structures of the MCPyV major capsid protein VP1 both
      alone and in complex with several sialylated oligosaccharides. A shallow binding 
      site on the apical surface of the VP1 capsomer recognizes the disaccharide
      Neu5Ac-alpha2,3-Gal through a complex network of interactions. MCPyV engages
      Neu5Ac in an orientation and with contacts that differ markedly from those
      observed in other polyomavirus complexes with sialylated receptors. Mutations in 
      the Neu5Ac binding site abolish MCPyV infection, highlighting the relevance of
      the Neu5Ac interaction for MCPyV entry. Our study thus provides a powerful
      platform for the development of MCPyV-specific vaccines and antivirals.
      Interestingly, engagement of sialic acid does not interfere with initial
      attachment of MCPyV to cells, consistent with a previous proposal that attachment
      is mediated by a class of non-sialylated carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans.
      Our results therefore suggest a model in which sialylated glycans serve as
      secondary, post-attachment co-receptors during MCPyV infectious entry. Since
      cell-surface glycans typically serve as primary attachment receptors for many
      viruses, we identify here a new role for glycans in mediating, and perhaps even
      modulating, post-attachment entry processes.

AB  - The hypothesis was examined that physiologic variation of estrogen concentrations
      during the menstrual cycle can provoke BK virus (BKV) excretion. BKV and JCV
      viral loads were determined in urine specimens obtained almost daily from 20
      healthy, non-pregnant women over 2 months. Asymptomatic urinary shedding of BKV
      was observed in 123 (12.0%) of 1,021 specimens from 11 (55%) study subjects. Two 
      subjects excreted JCV in their urine, with one subject excreting detectable JCV
      in all urine specimens. Analysis of 36 complete menstrual cycles revealed no
      difference in the prevalence of BKV excretion between pre-ovulatory and
      post-ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle. The unexpected day-to-day
      variability in BKV excretion suggests that as yet unidentified factors may
      contribute to the periodic shedding of BKV by healthy women.

TI  - Cyclophilins facilitate dissociation of the human papillomavirus type 16 capsid
      protein L1 from the L2/DNA complex following virus entry.
PG  - 9875-87
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00980-12 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are composed of the major and minor capsid proteins,
      L1 and L2, that encapsidate a chromatinized, circular double-stranded DNA genome.
      At the outset of infection, the interaction of HPV type 16 (HPV16)
      (pseudo)virions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggers a conformational
      change in L2 that is facilitated by the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B (CyPB).
      This conformational change results in exposure of the L2 N terminus, which is
      required for infectious internalization. Following internalization, L2
      facilitates egress of the viral genome from acidified endosomes, and the L2/DNA
      complex accumulates at PML nuclear bodies. We recently described a mutant virus
      that bypasses the requirement for cell surface CyPB but remains sensitive to
      cyclosporine for infection, indicating an additional role for CyP following
      endocytic uptake of virions. We now report that the L1 protein dissociates from
      the L2/DNA complex following infectious internalization. Inhibition and small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CyPs blocked dissociation of L1
      from the L2/DNA complex. In vitro, purified CyPs facilitated the dissociation of 
      L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, CyPs released L1 capsomeres from partially disassembled HPV16
      pseudovirions at slightly acidic pH. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPs
      mediate the dissociation of HPV L1 and L2 capsid proteins following acidification
      of endocytic vesicles.

TI  - Dynamics of pregnancy-associated polyomavirus urinary excretion: a prospective
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 1312-22
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23320 [doi]
AB  - Asymptomatic polyomaviruria of pregnancy has been documented in point prevalence 
      studies, but little attention has been given to the dynamics of polyomavirus
      excretion during pregnancy because of its benign course. We tested the hypothesis
      that the frequency and/or magnitude of polyomavirus excretion would increase as
      pregnancy progresses. Urine specimens were obtained prospectively from 179
      healthy women during uncomplicated pregnancies and 37 healthy non-pregnant women.
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV) viral loads in urine, blood, and rectal and vaginal swabs collected
      during routine obstetric and gynecologic clinic visits. Asymptomatic urinary
      shedding of BKV and/or JCV was observed in 384 (48.0%) of 800 specimens from 100 
      (55.8%) pregnant women. BKV excretion was more common in pregnant than
      non-pregnant women (41.3% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.0026). The frequency of JCV excretion 
      was no different in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. The frequency and
      magnitude of polyomavirus shedding did not vary with gestational age. Post-partum
      shedding of BKV, but not JCV, rapidly decreased to undetectable levels.
      Pregnancy-associated BKV excretion begins early in pregnancy and terminates
      rapidly post-partum. Neither the frequency nor magnitude of BKV or JCV shedding
      increased with pregnancy progression. Further study into the host factors that
      regulate pregnancy-associated BKV excretion may allow identification of the host 
      factors that predict susceptibility to BKV-associated diseases in immune
      compromised patients.

AB  - Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with capsids composed primarily of 72
      pentamers of the viral VP1 protein, which forms the outer shell of the capsid and
      binds to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors. Highly conserved VP1 proteins
      from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To
      determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding
      site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor
      usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40),
      which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and
      entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize
      viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these
      mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer
      stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind
      to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an
      infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1.
      Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more
      efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside
      receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1
      binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and
      they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to
      accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding
      is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study 
      of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, 
      and evolution.
